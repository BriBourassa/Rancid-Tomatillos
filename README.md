# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract:
"Rancid Tomatillos" is an app inspired by a certain movie rating website. In it the user can view a list of movies, see the rating by hovering their pointer over the poster for that movie, and click to see more details.

## Preview of App:

## Learning Goals:
This project was our first dive into using React, Cypress, and Router.

## Wins and Challenges:

## Future Iterations:
We would love to add more styling and search/filter functions, but our main goal was to get comfortable with new frameworks and the styling was lower on the priority list than feeling recklessly confident about our goals.
