# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract:
"Rancid Tomatillos" is an app inspired by a certain movie rating website. In it the user can view a list of movies, see the rating by hovering their pointer over the poster for that movie, and click to see more details.

## Preview of App:

When the mouse hovers over a movie poster, you can see an overlay with that movie's rating.

## Learning Goals:
This project was our first dive into using React, Cypress, and Router. 

## Wins and Challenges:
In this project we were learning multiple new technologies, and we decided to double down on our understanding of Cypress as our extension, as well as focus on adding loading states and error handling to our application. 

Testing the hover state in Cypress was a definite challenge, as Cypress doesn't have a fully developed `hover()` command, as you can see in this [github issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/10). This specific test suite in our project is still in development. 

A big win for us was refactoring our application to include router. I could see our understanding of how to handle different React errors grow as we rapid fire resolved a series of errors as we embarked on a major reorganization.


## Future Iterations:
We would love to add more styling and search/filter functions, but our main goal was to get comfortable with new frameworks and the styling was lower on the priority list than feeling recklessly confident about our goals.
