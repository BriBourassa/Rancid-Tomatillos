# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract:
"Rancid Tomatillos" is an app inspired by a certain movie rating website. In it the user can view a list of movies, see the rating by hovering their pointer over the poster for that movie, and click to see more details.

## Preview of App:

When the mouse hovers over a movie poster, you can see an overlay with that movie's rating.

## Learning Goals:
This project was our first dive into using React, Cypress, and Router. 

## Wins and Challenges:
We really struggled with Cypress and therefore decided to choose adding more tests as our extension. We did both happy and sad paths


## Future Iterations:
We would love to add more styling and search/filter functions, but our main goal was to get comfortable with new frameworks and the styling was lower on the priority list than feeling recklessly confident about our goals.
